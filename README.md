# SchoolStuff
### Note that this project isn't finished and most likely never will since schools are annoying and for some reason hate privacy and no I don't just mean them looking at browser histroy they even envade chats with other people






## About

This project is meant to be a place where students can regain privacy and have fun cause not gonna lie school is really really boring

You can find many things such as...

1. Games/Web ports (note this could lead to DMCA and copyright so it could be taken down)
2. Privacy things
3. Browser Storage (so schools can't view your files but it still does use your storage just in a different way)
4. WebOS
5. And many more things (that i won't list cause i'm lazy and it's 9PM at the time making this)
